**Mission** <br><br>
To create a website capable of guiding new Warthunder players to <br>
a ground vehicle archetype that would fit their needs, wants, and desires <br>
while still being vague enough to let the players really learn how the <br>
vehicles work by playing them in the game itself.

**Website Contents** <br><br>

The Website will have five different pages, <br>
one homepage, three information pages, and one game page.<br>
All of these pages will follow a layout that makes it similar to a<br>
modern driver's viewport. This includes the screen, a button leading<br>
to the homepage, a button leading to the game page, two arrow buttons<br>
which cycle across the three information pages, and the title. <br><br>

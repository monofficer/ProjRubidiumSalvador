_________________________________________________________________

**Mission** <br><br>
To create a website capable of guiding new Warthunder players to <br>
a ground vehicle archetype that would fit their needs, wants, and desires <br>
while still being vague enough to let the players really learn how the <br>
vehicles work by playing them in the game itself.
_________________________________________________________________

**Website Contents** <br><br>

The Website will have five different pages, <br>
one homepage, three information pages, and one game page.<br>
All of these pages will follow a layout that makes it similar to a<br>
modern driver's viewport. This includes the screen, a button leading<br>
to the homepage, a button leading to the game page, two arrow buttons<br>
which cycle across the three information pages, and the title. <br><br>

**Homepage** <br><br>

The Homepage, also known as the menu, is the mainpage as to where the <br>
user is to directed to first.  Just like every other page, it follows <br>
the Driver Vieport Mimicking Layout, the only difference being the <br>
screen.  On the top of the screen, you have a question "<CHOOSE YOUR NATION"> <br>
Below, is three different symbols, a Star, a symmetric cross, and a Hammer and Sickle. <br>
Above the symbols are the names of the nations connected to the symbols, The Star is the  <br>
United States of America, the symmetric cross being Germany, and the Hammer and Sickle <br>
being the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (The Soviet Union). Hovering<br>
over the symbols shows the tooltip "Proceed to Information page" each <br>
Nation has it's own information page.

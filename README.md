**Mission** <br><br>
To portray a more realistic, less stylized, and less romanticized <br>
interpretation of war, specifically, following the lens of a young<br>
soldier during the great war. The only people who achieve peace in war<br>
are dead.<br><br>

**Game Content** <br><br>

The Website or more specifically, the game, will have a classic point and click feel.<br>
For the first dozen or so dialogues, the user will be a young enlistee, then, for the<br>
next couple dozen will have the user go through basic training, and on the truck on the way to the frontline.<br>
Just a couple hundred meters away, the user must leave the truck, and walk to your trench<br>
where on the way you must put on your gas mask, and if you dont on time, you die.<br><br>

After you reach the frontline, you will enter your post and hold it until night comes,<br>
that is when you pick to either stay in your post, or join your peers.<br><br>

The rest of the story will continue, according to your choices, there is a planned 10 endings, some just alternates of the other.<br><br>

The user interface also changes according to the stage they are in, but by default,<br>
the interface will have a simple image to show your location, and the ability to look<br>
left and right on certain pages; to continue stages, you can click the center of the screen.<br>
When the user enters the training stage, they are given an inventory, simply just a<br>
basic interface which shows how many items you have (uses text, not images)<br>
The items in the inventory depletes and increases according to your choices,<br>
EACH ITEM IS IMPORTANT.<br><br>

I will be using JS to randomize the code that is needed in one of the endings.<br>
I will also be saving the test progress of the user in that ending by saving <br>
their progress in LocalStorage.<br><br>

**REQUIRED FOR CS2 PROPOSAL** <br><br>
Final Title: Boots
Features: Interactable Bag button, with proper pseudo-inventory, an occasional blinking effect, a numerical input -> corresponding text output test, and (hopefully) realistic images.
Definition of done: The project is only truly done when the creator believes it is, but from an academic perspective, it is only done when I have all features working.

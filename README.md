# THE BIG THREE

The following information will always be subject to change, but as of the first official version, the following will be followed. <br>
Initial Version: V1.0 (JANUARY 09 2026)<br>
Current Version: V1.0<br><br><br>

This made for all of the rare Warthunder players out there, you are my family.<br><br>
_________________________________________________________________

**Mission** <br><br>
To create a website capable of guiding new Warthunder players to <br>
a ground vehicle archetype that would fit their needs, wants, and desires <br>
while still being vague enough to let the players really learn how the <br>
vehicles work by playing them in the game itself.
_________________________________________________________________

**Website Contents** <br><br>

The Website will have five different pages, <br>
one homepage, three information pages, and one game page.<br>
All of these pages will follow a layout that makes it similar to a<br>
modern driver's viewport. This includes the screen, a button leading<br>
to the homepage, a button leading to the game page, two arrow buttons<br>
which cycle across the three information pages, and the title. <br><br>

_________________________________________________________________

**Homepage** <br><br>

The Homepage, also known as the menu, is the mainpage as to where the <br>
user is to directed to first.  Just like every other page, it follows <br>
the Driver Vieport Mimicking Layout, the only difference being the <br>
screen.  On the top of the screen, you have a question "<CHOOSE YOUR NATION"> <br>
Below, is three different symbols, a Star, a symmetric cross, and a Hammer and Sickle. <br>
Above the symbols are the names of the nations connected to the symbols, The Star is the  <br>
United States of America, the symmetric cross being Germany, and the Hammer and Sickle <br>
being the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (The Soviet Union). Hovering<br>
over the symbols shows the tooltip "Proceed to Information page" each <br>
Nation has it's own information page. <br><br>

_________________________________________________________________

**Information Page** <br><br>

The Information Page/s are three pages connected to a nation, each one <br>
all having the same layout. On the top of the screen (The in-website screen <br>
not the user's screen) is the symbol and name of the nation. below it <br>
are 5 different symbols, all of which corresponding to actual Warthunder <br>
symbols, under each symbol is the vehicle archetype. These are Light tanks, <br>
Medium tanks, Heavy tanks, Anti Aircraft, and finally Tank destroyers. <br>
Beneath each of these archetypes is three different attributes or <br>
"stats" these are Speed, Armour, and Firepower, next to it is a set of <br>
stars denoting the archetype's proficiency in those attributes, these <br>
could range from 1 to 5 stars, no more no less. below this is a warning, <br>
often mixed with humour, that warns the user about the problem of the <br>
archetype, whether that may be lack of speed, survivability, and more, <br>
this warning will be put under a dropdown menu. <br><br>

_________________________________________________________________

**Game Page** <br><br>

The Game page, or more accurately, the Test Page, is a page made for <br>
the user to really figure out what archetype suits them best. Now this <br>
page, has the following layout. On the top of the web screen, is the <br>
message "INPUT HOW MUCH YOU VALUE THESE STATS", Underneath is the three <br>
basic stats, next to them is a text box where the user can input a priority <br>
from 1-3 ONLY , below that is a submit button which will only work if all <br>
conditions are met. below that is the message "YOUR ARCHETYPE IS" and <br>
below it is a space where you can view what your archetype is, according <br>
to how much you value the stats. To the left of this is a reminders space <br>
where the user ir reminded that they can only have one of each position <br>
(1, 2, 3) and that the information you input will only be kept until the <br>
website is reset.

**REQUIRED FOR CS2 PROPOSAL** <br><br>
Final Title: The Dark Triad
Features: Interactable Custom image type buttons, a flickering screen with tv-like effects, a numerical input -> corresponding text output test, and (hopefully) "shaders" on the interface.
Definition of done: The project is only truly done when the creator believes it is, but from an academic perspective, it is only done when I have all features working.
